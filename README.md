# Classic React course project - <a href="http://battle.ui.dev/">Github Battle App</a></h3>

This is the repository for ui.dev's "Classic React" course project.

For more information on the course, visit **[ui.dev/classic-react](https://ui.dev/classic-react/)**.

### Project

This project is a "Github Battle" app. You'll be able to see the most popular repos for a variety of languages as well as battle two Github users to see who has the better profile.

This project showcases my capability to learn rapidly and apply software development best practices in a real-world project. It serves as a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and professional growth in software development.
